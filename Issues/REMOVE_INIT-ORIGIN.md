Here is a command-by-command breakdown of the process you followed along with explanations for each:

### Command-wise Explanation

---

1. **Removing the existing remote origin**  
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command removes the remote repository named `origin` from the current Git repository. It disconnects the local repository from the remote repository.

---

2. **Checking if any remotes are set**  
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command lists the remotes currently associated with the repository. Since you just removed the remote, it shows no remotes.

---

3. **Attempting to remove `.git` directory using Windows Command Prompt syntax (incorrect syntax for Git Bash)**  
   ```bash
   rmdir /s /q .git
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command is meant to remove the `.git` directory recursively and forcefully in Command Prompt, but it failed in Git Bash because the syntax is not recognized there.
   - **Error**: The error was caused by using incorrect syntax specific to Command Prompt, not Git Bash.

---

4. **Removing the `.git` directory correctly in Git Bash**  
   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command is used to remove the `.git` directory and all its contents recursively and forcefully. It's the correct syntax for Git Bash (or any Unix-based system like Linux or macOS). This effectively uninitializes the Git repository.

---

5. **Checking the repository status (after `.git` removal)**  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command checks the status of the Git repository. Since you removed the `.git` folder in the previous step, Git will not find a repository, so it will return the error:
     ```bash
     fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
     ```

---

6. **Initializing a new Git repository**  
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a fresh `.git` directory and sets up version control for the project again.

---

### Summary of Commands and Effects

1. **Remove Remote Origin**: `git remote remove origin`  
   - Disconnects the repository from any remote source.

2. **Check for Existing Remotes**: `git remote -v`  
   - Confirms that no remotes are set after removing `origin`.

3. **Remove `.git` directory with incorrect syntax**: `rmdir /s /q .git`  
   - This failed due to the wrong syntax for Git Bash.

4. **Remove `.git` directory successfully**: `rm -rf .git`  
   - This command deleted the `.git` directory and uninitialized the Git repository.

5. **Check status of repository**: `git status`  
   - Since the `.git` directory was removed, Git reports that it's no longer a Git repository.

6. **Initialize new Git repository**: `git init`  
   - A new Git repository was created in the current directory.
